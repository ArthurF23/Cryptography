*These are notes to myself as I tend to lose my train of thought and lose track of where I am when I come back to this after doing something*

1/20/22 Change encryption output to output hex, then change the decrypt function to handle hex input to handle out of range ascii characters.

1/21/22 Note: I think the problem is that the algorythm was intended to take 8 chars at a time, therefor it is freaking out when i feed it one at a time.

Changed encrypt and decrypt to take the specified amount from the example. still no luck.

It works when you do it how the example does it. whats different here?

EVERYTHING IN ENCRYPT WORKS IT'S SOULY IN THE DECRYPT FUNCTION

Completed? yes

1/23/22 Fix decrypt to take any length of string and decrypt properly. May need to modify encrypt to fill empty spaces with a specific value which will be removed after decrypt but before it's added to the output string.

1/23/22 Once the AES encryption and decryption works compentently, implement key generation
