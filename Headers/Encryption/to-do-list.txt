*These are notes to myself as I tend to lose my train of thought and lose track of where I am when I come back to this after doing something*

1/20/22 Change encryption output to output hex, then change the decrypt function to handle hex input to handle out of range ascii characters.

1/21/22 Note: I think the problem is that the algorythm was intended to take 8 chars at a time, therefor it is freaking out when i feed it one at a time.

Changed encrypt and decrypt to take the specified amount from the example. still no luck.

It works when you do it how the example does it. whats different here?

EVERYTHING IN ENCRYPT WORKS IT'S SOULY IN THE DECRYPT FUNCTION

Completed? No, make decrypt work.
